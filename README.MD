## The Principle

Sparrow helps to extract and process data from scanned documents and pictures. It works with forms, invoices, receipts and other structured data.

It implements various methods to extract data. Version 1 of Skipper was focused on Donut ML model. Version 2 focus is on-premise LLMs.
